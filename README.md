gulp-jade-sass-autoprefixer-concat-browser-sync
=============================

A starter project including full setup for GulpJS, Jade, SASS, Autoprefixer, Concat &amp; BrowserSync

## System Preparation

To use this starter project, you'll need the following things installed on your machine.

1. [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) - use the installer.
2. [GulpJS](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) - `$ npm install -g gulp` (mac users may need sudo)

## Local Installation

1. Clone this repo, or download it into a directory of your choice.
2. Inside the directory, run `npm install`.

## Issues
Compiling Jade creates an unnecessary 'includes' folder inside 'build' folder.. still trying to prevent this to happen
